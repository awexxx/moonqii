	<strong>An extra Medal Clip Sharing method</strong>
</p>

<hr>

<p align="center">Ever needed a second method to share your clips to Discord or Guilded but don't have the space for Medal, are building a community or are on Guilded and don't have MedalBot?<br>
<strong>You've come to the right place!</strong></p>

<p align="center">This webhook is developed in PHP and POSTs to a basic webhook, whether that be Discord, Guilded, or maybe even Slack (if you're looking into that???)!<br>
This webhook is mainly for users who are building a community but don't clip games and just want a way for your users to share clips and/or are on Guilded or Slack (or any other social media service that accepts webhooks).<br>
However, this webhook does not have some things that Medal has, like auto-uploading, integrated uploading, and more. I still sincerely recommend using <a href="https://medal.tv/download">Medal</a>, maybe even use my <a href="https://medal.tv/?ref=awex_partner">partner link</a> ;).</p>
