As stated in the United States Copyright Act of 1976, Copyright without intention of following Fair Use guidelines is against the law and can be contested in court.<br>
If Team Moonqii is alerted to your content that is a blatant copy of Moonqii content, whether it may be a repost or claiming it is your own, you may be entitled to a copyright strike via YouTube ToS or any other platform you uploaded it to.
Moonqii is the soul owner of his videos and has copyright laws applied to his content.<br>

As stated in 17 U.S. Code  107 of the Copyright Doctrine of 1976;<br><br>
<strong>"Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.<br> In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include;<br>
(1)
the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;<br>
(2)
the nature of the copyrighted work;<br>
(3)
the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and<br>
(4)
the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.<br>
The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors."<br></strong><br>

If the content you steal and upload does not follow these guidelines, Team Moonqii reserves every right to take your video down.<br>
