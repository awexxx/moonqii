<h2>FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)</h2>
<p><b>1. When did you actually start doing YouTube?</b><br>
Moonqii actually started YouTube in 2015 under the alias "Nathan Gaming". That channel was deleted in 2016 though after formerly "ItzMoonFN" was started.</p>

<p><b>2. What do you do on your channel?</b><br>
Moonqii regularly does gaming and other random content on his main channel, moonqii.</p>

<p><b>3. Do you do all of this on your own?<br></b>
Well yes, but actually no. Moon consistently pumps out content. Alex Frantz, Plague Media Group oversees all partnerships, affiliations, and more (entirely because Moon is incapable of writing his own emails..)</p>
